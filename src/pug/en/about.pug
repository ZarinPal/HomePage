							|While online payment was very young in Iran and accepting online payment gateways was very difficult,an Iranian startup called ZarinPal was born in April 2010 to create a safe and trusting environment for online sellers and buyers and providing an online payment gateway as simple as possible.
							|ZarinPal was welcomed from Sellers and buyers and this creative startup grew up very fast to become a pioneer and reliable business today in the field of giving solutions and providing online payment services. ZarinPal is now an independent group and under the Multi Ventures, a multinational investment fund.

						h3.title-section Why ZarinPal?
						p If we want to express ZarinPalâ€™s point of view in one sentence, it would be simplifying online payment process. Our effort in ZarinPal has always been to provide the most pioneering services in the context of web, mobile, debit card, POS and mPOS. Our goal is to simplify payment steps and increase successful payments to its maximum number at the time the payment decision is made, the fact that has been paid less attention to in Iran. This is true that paying fees is not common in Iran, but accepting the fact that providing services to users has costs, has convinced our users to have a logical payment. Of course, we also do our best to provide the best services along with reasonable fee rate to our users.
